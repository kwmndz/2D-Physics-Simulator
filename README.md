# 2D-Physics-Simulator

### In progress


#### IMMEDIATE TODO:

* Clean up code and create seperate files for classes
* Create a parent class for objects effected by Verlet's Integration
* Fix "ball" getting stuck when bouncing in a circular restriction

#### FUTURE TODO:
* A LOT.
* Implement threading


### General Description (subject to change)

2D Deterministic physics simulatiom.
Uses Verlet Integration.
Will be very customizable.
Will work as a library also.
New "tabs" with different subjects, such as: springs, harmonic motion, fluids (scary), etc
